# java-2-json-size-estimator

Estimates the size of a Java object represented in JSON.

The size depends on a lot of things, like how large Strings and collections are expected and how certain datatypes are mapped. 
Because of this, the min and max values are just that - estimates. 

For usage see the main function.
